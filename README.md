Abstract 

In this Research Journal I will be writing about Artificial Intelligence (AI) sometimes known by machine intelligence. I will be addressing whether computers can think and whether they’re more efficient than the mind of a human. I’ll also be writing about how far AI has come in the past 50 years and what is expected to happen in the next 50 years. It’ll also compare the IQ of the best AI’s to that of a human. The research journal will go over how machine learning can be used to complete tasks and how machine learning can be implementing into that of a strategy game. 

Introduction 

AI is a section in computer science where machines are made into intelligent machines to complete various activities. AI is starting to become an essential asset in the computer technology sector. The main use for AI is to complete tasks such as; problem solving, planning, knowledge, reasoning etc. Learning is a core process for AI because it can’t just instantly be able to do anything you desire it to it’ll need to learn the best possible way to achieve the outcome by repeating the process to and learn from it each time. Google’s AI has an IQ of over 55, but in 50 years what will the common AI’s IQ be? 

 

Are machines more efficient than the mind of a human? 

Much like humans' machines can also learn, but different to humans' machines will store data which it can pull from at any time, it can remember data a lot better than a human can as ones it is stored it will be never be deleted unless it is programmed to replace this data with a new bit of data. Nowadays computers can be programmed to do almost anything, therefore computers can compete against the human mind in set activities if they were programmed to do so. In reference one [1] it mentions a game called ‘Imitation game’ in this game there are 3 players, player A, player B and player C, player A is male and player B is female, player C must guess which player the female is by asking various questions. If a computer is programmed to play this game would it be more efficient than that a human would be? Computers can store information and access this stored information with great speed, humans have drawbacks when a lot of information is thrown at them as they won’t be able to remember it all therefore a human player will have to write the information down whereas the computer won’t need to do this it’ll just have it stored in the memory. In reference one [1] it asks if computers can think, I wouldn’t use the term think I would say computers can compare data if it has the data stored, if a computer has competed against various hosts it can store the information of how the game went and compare the next game to the current one and see if it can use this information to progress in the current game this is what I mean by computers can learn too. If the human was behind a computer the human would be much more efficient than an AI would be as there would be no drawbacks as the human can store all the information on the machine manually and access the stored information just as  the AI would do but the human mind can think about the stored information whereas the AI can only compare data which it has stored and the human mind has the capacity to think about the situation. In Reference 2 [2] it focuses the scope of how machines learn, which tells us that the computer would learn from playing the game and it would get better and be able to deduct certain patterns and traits of the user and use this information to get the result that it needs to win the game. 

 

How far has AI come and how far can it go? 

In reference one [1] it mentioned that from 1828-1839 Charles Babbage had planned to make a machine called the ‘Analytic Engine’ but at the time he proposed the idea it wasn’t created as it was thought to be not a very attractive idea, it wasn’t until another 100 years went by before the first general use computer was built. The first AI ever built was called ‘The Logic Theorist’. The Logic Theorist was built in 1955 by Newell and Simon but the first person to call the program Artificial Intelligence was John McCarthy he is now known as the ‘Father of AI’. Comparing the very first AI to that of let's say Siri there is massive changes, Siri stores the information given and uses that information to answer questions that’s thrown at it, it also has voice recognition and uses the internet to get answers on the questions it is asked. Siri’s IQ is just under 24 therefore it’s nowhere near smarter enough to compete against the human mind, but in 50 years who knows what the most efficient AI’s IQ will be. In reference 2 [2] it goes over the key elements of machine learning, one of the main ones was visual perception which is patterns and scene analysis, if an AI can deduct patterns it can easily spot patterns when playing Imitation Game. So, the more the AI plays the imitation game the more the machine will learn and pick up patterns and begin to succeed by referencing these patterns. 

 

 

 

Conclusion 

Computers can be more efficient than humans in some situations if they’re programmed correctly, but in 2018 they are in no way more efficient than a human mind in every situation, but in another 50 years that could change, I believe by the current rate technology is evolving in 50 years' time that AI will be much more efficient than that of the human mind. As we have mentioned earlier Siri’s IQ was just under 24 but Googles AI is almost double that. The average IQ is between 85 and 110 therefore AI’s are about half the IQ of the average human, but I believe in 50 years the IQ of an average AI will be the same maybe even more than the average human. In reference two [2] it talks about how machines can learn the more advanced an AI gets the quicker it can learn so therefore if it learns quicker it can do a lot more which would definitely improve the IQ of the AI so I believe in years to come the IQ of AI’s will be significantly higher than what it is now.
